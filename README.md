# RabbitMQ Exporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter?branch=master) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/kbudde/rabbitmq-exporter.svg)](http://microbadger.com/images/kbudde/rabbitmq-exporter "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

Prometheus exporter for RabbitMQ metrics.
Data is scraped by [prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

# Breaking change -> 1.0.0

- RABBIT_CAPABILITIES are set to bert,no_sort
- new default port 9419

## Installation

### Binary release

You can download the latest release on the [release page](https://github.com/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter/releases).
Configuration is done with environment variables. See below.

### docker: rabbitmq container with network sharing

The rabbitmq_exporter is sharing the network interface with the rabbitmq container -> it is possible to use localhost and default user/password (guest).

1. Start rabbitMQ

        docker run -d -e RABBITMQ_NODENAME=my-rabbit --name my-rabbit -p 9419:9419 rabbitmq:3-management

1. Start rabbitmq_exporter in container.

        docker run -d --net=container:my-rabbit kbudde/rabbitmq-exporter

Now your metrics are exposed through [http://host:9419/metrics](http://host:9419/metrics). The management plugin does not need to be exposed.

## Configuration

Rabbitmq_exporter uses environment variables for configuration.
Settings:

Environment variable|default|description
--------------------|-------|------------
RABBIT_URL | <http://127.0.0.1:15672>| url to rabbitMQ management plugin (must start with http(s)://)
RABBIT_USER | guest | username for rabbitMQ management plugin. User needs monitoring tag!
RABBIT_PASSWORD | guest | password for rabbitMQ management plugin
RABBIT_USER_FILE| | location of file with username (useful for docker secrets)
RABBIT_PASSWORD_FILE | | location of file with password (useful for docker secrets)
PUBLISH_PORT | 9419 | Listening port for the exporter
PUBLISH_ADDR | "" | Listening host/IP for the exporter
OUTPUT_FORMAT | TTY | Log ouput format. TTY and JSON are suported
LOG_LEVEL | info | log level. possible values: "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "fatal", or "panic"
CAFILE | ca.pem | path to root certificate for access management plugin. Just needed if self signed certificate is used. Will be ignored if the file does not exist
SKIPVERIFY | false | true/0 will ignore certificate errors of the management plugin
SKIP_VHOST | ^$ |regex, matching vhost names are not exported. First performs INCLUDE_VHOST, then SKIP_VHOST
INCLUDE_VHOST | .* | reqgex vhost filter. Only queues in matching vhosts are exported
INCLUDE_QUEUES | .* | reqgex queue filter. just matching names are exported
SKIP_QUEUES | ^$ |regex, matching queue names are not exported (useful for short-lived rpc queues). First performed INCLUDE, after SKIP
RABBIT_CAPABILITIES | bert,no_sort | comma-separated list of extended scraping capabilities supported by the target RabbitMQ server
RABBIT_EXPORTERS | exchange,node,queue | List of enabled modules. Just "connections" is not enabled by default
RABBIT_TIMEOUT | 30 | timeout in seconds for retrieving data from management plugin.
MAX_QUEUES | 0 | max number of queues before we drop metrics (disabled if set to 0)
EXCLUDE_METRICS | | Metric names to exclude from export. comma-seperated. e.g. "recv_oct, recv_cnt". See exporter_*.go for names

Example and recommended settings:

    PUBLISH_PORT=9419 RABBIT_CAPABILITIES=bert,no_sort ./rabbitmq_exporter

### Extended RabbitMQ capabilities

Newer version of RabbitMQ can provide some features that reduce
overhead imposed by scraping the data needed by this exporter. The
following capabilities are currently supported in
`RABBIT_CAPABILITIES` env var:

* `no_sort`: By default RabbitMQ management plugin sorts results using
  the default sort order of vhost/name. This sorting overhead can be
  avoided by passing empty sort argument (`?sort=`) to RabbitMQ
  starting from version 3.6.8. This option can be safely enabled on
  earlier 3.6.X versions, but it'll not give any performance
  improvements. And it's incompatible with 3.4.X and 3.5.X.
* `bert`: Since 3.6.9 (see
   <https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/367>) RabbitMQ
   supports BERT encoding as a JSON alternative. Given that BERT
   encoding is implemented in C inside the Erlang VM, it's way more
   effective than pure-Erlang JSON encoding. So this greatly reduces
   monitoring overhead when we have a lot of objects in RabbitMQ.

## Metrics

All metrics (except golang/prometheus metrics) are prefixed with "rabbitmq_".

## Docker

To create a docker image locally it is recommened to use the Makefile.
Promu is used for building the statically linked binary which is added to the scratch image.

       make docker
